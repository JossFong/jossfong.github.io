<h1>Many Ideas</h1>
<h2>Not so many skills</h2>

<h3 class="one">Weather and Suicide in NYC</h3>
<p>
I would like to examine data on suicides in New York City over the past several years to look for correlations with weather/climate data such as seasonality, temperature, precipitation, cloud cover or humidity. Suicide data comes from <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/data/vs.shtml">NYC</a> or the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/suicide/datasources.html">CDC</a>. They're behind a few years, but that shouldn't matter for my purposes. <a href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/okx/climate_cms.html">NOAA</a> has historical daily weather data.</p>

<h3>NYC Energy Consumption</h3>
<p>
I'm interested in which residential areas in the city use the least and most amount of energy per capita. Data on 2010 residential energy consumption by zipcode is available through <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Environmental-Sustainability/Electric-Consumption-by-ZIP-Code-2010/74cu-ncm4">NYC Open Data</a> and I can get population data for the zip codes from the Census American Fact Finder.</p>

<h3>Women with Science Degrees</h3>
<p>
Though a large portion of undergraduate women complete a bachelors degree in science, a much smaller proportion of those who finish graduate school are women. I'd like to illustrate that gap with data from the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/showpub.cfm?TopID=2">National Science Foundation</a>.</p>

<h3>Gender Representation</h3>
<p>
This would be an interactive service that could tell each person, based on their address, whether their congressional district has ever elected a woman to the House of Representatives. The challenges with this one are that I have no idea how to build that interactivity, but I think it's necessary since most people don't know their congressional district. Also, I havent found an existing source of historical data containing all the Reps and their genders (this should exist somewhere, right?)</p>
